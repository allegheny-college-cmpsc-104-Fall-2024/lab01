## Understanding Version Control

### What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to manage and keep a history of your work. In software development, it helps developers collaborate, keep track of different versions of code, and easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

### Types of Version Control Systems
There are 3 main types of version control systems:
1) Local version control - this is the simpliest type, where changes are stored on your local computer
2) Centralized version control - in this system, there's a single central server that stores all the versioned files
3) Distributed version control - this system allows every developer to have a complete copy of the project's history on their own machine

## Git

### Introduction to Git

### Git's Key Features
Branching and merging, distributed system, version tracking, colloboration
## The Staging Environment and Commit Process

### The Staging Environment
The staging environment in Git is a place where chanes are prepared before being commited
### The Commit Process
The commit process in git is when changes from the staging area are saved to the project's history
## Conclusion

### Reflecting on the Importance of Version Control and Git
Understanding version control and Git is crucial in software engineering because they help manage code efficiently, especially in team environments.
